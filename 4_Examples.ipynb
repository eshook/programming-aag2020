    "# Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook we will go through three different examples using three different types of data (freeform text from a novel, spreadsheet population data, and spatially structured New York City, USA collision data) to highlight different possibilities in using Python for research. These are not exhaustive examples. They illustate key ideas and provide practice reading code (some of which is completely new!) and trying to use programming comments and documentation to make sense of it. Then potentially taking the next step of modifying the code to do something else. Please note that the instructional materials intentionally did not cover everything that you will see in this notebook as part of the learning is 'learning to learn' how to work through new types of Python code that you might see in tutorials or other research examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will learn in this notebook: \n",
    "1. Read and Analyze Text Files\n",
    "2. Read, Filter, and Visualize Comma Separated Variable (CSV) files from Excel\n",
    "3. Map spatial data in a Comma Separated Variable (CSV) file from Excel\n",
    "4. Reading new code including new data structures (e.g., dictionaries and lists) and new techniques (e.g., for loops)\n",
    "5. Making small adjustments and modifications and re-running code to test if it works (i.e., don't change everything at once)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this exercise walks you through examples and gives you reminders on where to look for help. So that you can start learning how to make sense of unfamiliar pieces of code and potentially use them to advance your own research."
