    "In this first activity we will focus on using notebooks to tell your research story.  This is a crucial step, because it is easy to forget *why* you are programming when you are trying to figure out how to code. By creating a computational notebook that outlines your research story you can remind yourself what you want your code to do. This is helpful to direct your code and your learning to achieve your research goals.\n"
